## About <a name = "about"></a>

Personal dotfiles, using xonsh and asdf.

### Applications included <a name = "apps"></a>

When setting up this project, multiple additional utilites are also installed:
    - [asdf-vm](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), for installing multiple runtimes (set in `.tool-versions` file)
    - [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa), replacing ls with an alias
    - [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl), an hex viewer
    - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), a similar application to cat but with syntax highlighting (among other functionalities)
    - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), providing similar functionality to the common find program, while being more efficient
    - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), which does the same for grep
    - [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), containing short examples for a lot of tools (for when `man` is too much)

Additionally, [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is installed in the appropiate folder for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and my personal [`init.vim`](init.vim) file is likewise linked into place.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

[Check the prerequisites](#prerequisites).

Afterwards, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kaylebor/xonsh_dotfiles.git ~/xonsh_dotfiles
cd ~/xonsh_dotfiles
```

You may need to change file permissions:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Finally, run the [setup file](setup).
```
bash setup.sh
```

`setup` contains some additional, optional arguments; check `./setup --help` for more info

For additional, custom configuration, create a new file called `.localenv` in the `xonsh_dotfiles` folder, with Xonsh syntax.

*OPTIONAL* In order to use xonsh as default shell, `chsh` is not recommended; instead, add something like this to `.bashrc`:
```
XONSH_PATH=/path/to/xonsh
if [[ -t 1 && -x $XONSH_PATH ]]; then
    exec $XONSH_PATH
fi
```

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

[Install xonsh](https://xon.sh/installation.html).

Curl is also needed; if not present, check your distro package repositories.
